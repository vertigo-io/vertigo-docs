**Vertigo** is a Java platform for building modern, comprehensive, maintainable, and scalable business applications or information systems.

It is designed to maximize value addition:
- Simple tasks are straightforward.
- More complex tasks are handled by minimizing their impact through plug-ins.
- Several high-value components are provided out-of-the-box, including modern UI, search functionality, and security features.

The automotive industry has embraced the concept of a “platform,” allowing rapid creation of different models (sedans, compacts, SUVs, etc.) from a common base. Customizations and options enhance the range of choices while sharing costs, minimizing industrial risks, and maximizing value for customers.

**Vertigo**, applies this principle to information systems and digital services. Its core application ensures robustness, quality, and development efficiency. Innovative options can be added based on business objectives. **Vertigo** is an *Opinionated Software Development Framework*, maximizing development efficiency for business applications (especially management applications) while allowing flexibility beyond that scope. Unlike broad general-purpose frameworks, it excels in its domain while still accommodating a wide range of use cases.


**Vertigo**, as the core application of the platform, natively incorporates all essential components for a modern application: search, security, mobility, analytics, and data visualization.

Here’s a breakdown of the components that make up Vertigo:

- [**Vertigo-Core**](/overview/core) : A powerful and lightweight Java framework.
- [**Vertigo-Extensions**](/overview/extensions) : A collection of extension modules that address key challenges in business applications, allowing rapid development
- [**Vertigo-Connectors**](/overview/connectors) : A set of low-level connectors to third-party libraries and products, simplifying development in edge cases
- [**Vertigo-Studio**](/overview/studio) :  A dedicated design tool for business applications, enhancing efficiency and consistency

Vertigo empowers developers to create robust and efficient applications while maintaining flexibility beyond typical management applications. It’s a platform designed to maximize value and accelerate project delivery
